# ASA 2023 Schedule

The data folder contains the scheduled of presentations for the [2023 American Sociological Association Annual Meeting](https://www.asanet.org/annual-meeting/2023-annual-meeting/). The [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nealcaren/asa2023/main/data/asa_2023_schedule.csv) contains the title, abstract, authors, sponsor, where and when for each paper. Please note that the data was scraped in early June and might not be entirely accurate anymore.

I've also included my script for a schedule using Nomic's [Atlas](https://docs.nomic.ai), which is maybe the easiest way to plot and host an unstructured text dataset. Let me know if you create your own visualization, or anything else, using the data!
